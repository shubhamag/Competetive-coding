# Competetive-coding
Interesting coding problems or solutions
Mainly intended for practicing my C++
divided into basics where I play around with syntax, stdlib, pointers, sorting
and "leetcode", where I code leetcode problem solutions


All code tested with c++ 14, to compile:
g++ -std=c++14  reverse_string.cpp -o reverse_string
